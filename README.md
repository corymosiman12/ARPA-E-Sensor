Directory structure should look like:

C:/.../root/
servers.conf
|--client/
|--server/

Plan on running everything from the root directory.  There will also be an external disk attached to the host.  This will (hopefully) be used for all data storage.  My current concern is that the I/O rate for USB 3.0 will not be high enough to write to disk, but we shall see.
